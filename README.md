# Alluvial-JS
Interactive alluvial plot using D3 and JavaScript.

The pathSankey.js file in this repository was not created by me. I borrowed the code from another GitHub user(link: https://github.com/jeinarsson/pathSankey). The Github user's repository includes an MIT license stating that the code can be copied, modified, distributed, etc.
